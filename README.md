# For
This is a little program that make some short loop using fonction "for".
<br/>
So, I am completely new in programming and my first issue is to compile my code (C++) outside of XCode (v. 4.2) or Sublime Text 2 (v. 2.0.2), or even Code Blocks (v. 13.12). And all this are because the output console in XCode cannot compile 'system("clear")' command. Instead I get a message: "TERM environment variable not set.".
<br/>
I tried compile in Terminal on my mac (os x 10.6.8) but I am not good enough in this stuff. Despite of fact that some my learning program can build and run in XCode my terminal can't see any gcc (I tried both commands: by gcc --version or g++ --version (or just -v) and I receive a message: "-bash: gcc: command not found".
<br/>
So and help would be welcome and I will be very greatful.
<br/>
Best Regards to everyone!
